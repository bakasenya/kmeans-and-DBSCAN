# 📊 Custom Clustering Algorithms: K-Means & DBSCAN

This repository contains custom, from-scratch implementations of two popular clustering algorithms — **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** — using only basic Python libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. The goal is to provide a transparent and educational view into how these algorithms work under the hood, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
